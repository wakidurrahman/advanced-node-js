# üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Building CLI Tools

## Working with CLI Tools

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env node
```

This above line is a `unix` and `unix-like` system(e.g. `Linux`, `MacOS`) directive known as the `shebang` or the `hashbang`(as per the two leading characters of its syntax, where `bang` is a synonym for exclamation point).

When a non-binary file has executable permissions and is run from the command line, the `hashbang` is checked so that the Operating System knows what interpreter to execute the text of the file with.

The command we instruct the `OS` to use is `/usr/bin/env node`. The path to `env` is typical across `unix` and `unix-like` systems. Passing the `node` as an argument to `/usr/bin/env` results in the full path to wherever `node` is installed being output.

This full path to the node binary then becomes what the `OS` uses to execute the text. On Windows systems, `npm` wraps the file referenced from the bin field of `my-cli/package.json` in a `.cmd` file.

Note that Top-Level Await syntax is supported from Node 14.3.0.

To complete the step of creating a node module executable file, we have to set the file permissions so the file is an executable. This can be done using the `chmod` command in the following way:

```bash
 $ chmod u+x bin/cmd.js
```

Let's run the following commands from the cli-tools folder to setup tool.

1. `chmod u+x bin/cmd.js`.‚¨áÔ∏è
2. `sudo npm link` ‚¨áÔ∏è
3. `npm link cli-tools`‚¨áÔ∏è
4. `cli-tools`

CLI Tools command

```bash

$ cli-tools --help
$ cli-tools -h
$ cli-tools --version
$ cli-tools -V

UpdateProduct
$ cli-tools updateProduct --help
$ cli-tools updateProduct E2 40
$ cli-tools updateProduct E1 4
$ cli-tools updateProduct E1 30

AddProduct
$ cli-tools addProduct --help
$ cli-tools addProduct electronics E3 Laptop 599 "Best mid-priced laptop money can buy"
$ cli-tools addProduct electronics E3 Server 999 A super powerful server to run all your node applications on

List
`Usage: cli-tools list [options] [CATEGORY]`
$ cli-tools list --help
$ cli-tools list --all
$ cli-tools list -a || cli-tools list all
$ cli-tools list electronics
$ cli-tools list confectionery

```

**Amazing work! Let's summarize what we have achieved so far.**

We have successfully created a terminal interface for our CLI application that displays helpful contextual information. It also parses the command-line arguments for us. We also have a very nice and declarative way of expressing our commands for our application. Now we can create and define specialized behavior based on the inputs to the application. Finally, we created a separate module to contain the utility functionality that the application will be using.

Let's try out the new and improved `cli-tools` tool. In one terminal from the project route, let's run the following command:

`$ npm run static`

In another terminal, with the mock-srv folder as the current working directory, let's execute the following command:

`$ npm run dev`

Now let's execute the following in another terminal window:

`$ cli-tools --help`

## Customizing the Terminal User Interface

### Implementing a Terminal User Interface

This interactive mode will provide the same functionality as the web app.
It will have the ability to select a category, display the products in that category and then fill out a from to add new products to the category.

We will need to add two new ecosystem modules: `chalk` and `enquirer`.

1. The [chalk](https://github.com/chalk/chalk) module is a convenient utility library for terminal styling, such as colors, boldness, underlining text background and so on.
2. The [enquirer](https://github.com/enquirer/enquirer) package can be likened to a form-input framework for the terminal.

Let's install the modules

`$ npm install chalk enquirer`


### Adding Interactivity 

We will now be creating a series of interactive prompts for the application. These are ways that we can move the end-user through a series of preemptive questions. Using the responses from the prompts, we can populate the required information needed for our business logic to work.

```bash
// Execute the application in both the interactive mode and as a CLI tool. 
$ cli-tools -i
$ cli-tools --interactive

// Independently enter each command‚Äôs prompt behavior to provide inputs, while also keeping the existing CLI functionality. 
  
$ cli-tools add --interactive
$ cli-tools list --interactive
$ cli-tools list -i -a
$ cli-tools update --interactive
```
