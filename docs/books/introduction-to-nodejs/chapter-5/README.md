# üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è  Navigating the Ecosystem

## Introduction

The Node.js ecosystem is diverse and extensive.

In order to build products we have to invest in researching, evaluating and comparing those ecosystem options or else build absolutely everything ourselves form scratch at greater cost. 



## #Ô∏è‚É£ Matching Requirement Scope to Library Scope

The need for an ecosystem package starts with a problem that needs to be solved. The first thing to determine when selecting a package to help solve a problem is the scope of the problem. 

Packages can be grouped into two categories: `libraries` and `frameworks`.

- A library provides some tools to perform certain tasks.
- A framework provides patterns and opinions that act as constraints around (mostly) business logic
