# Chapter 5. Navigating the Ecosystem

## Introduction

The Node.js ecosystem is diverse and extensive. Node itself started out with a small core philosophy, encouraging innovation in the ecosystem instead of in core. Over time, the core has expanded slightly but it is still mostly necessary to rely heavily on third-party modules for higher-level functionality.

Freedom and flexibility has led to rampant open source innovation providing many ecosystem options, but in order to build products we have to invest in researching, evaluating and comparing those ecosystem options or else build absolutely everything ourselves form scratch at greater cost. 

Learning Objectives

- Understand how to select particular libraries or frameworks for specific problem areas.
- Determine ways to interpret stats and avoid the pitfalls of large numbers.
- Discover shortcuts for speeding up the research and selection process.
- Understand the OSS social contract.


## Matching Requirement Scope to Library Scope

The need for an ecosystem package starts with a problem that needs to be solved. The first thing to determine when selecting a package to help solve a problem is the scope of the problem. 

Packages can be grouped into two categories: `libraries` and `frameworks`.

- A library provides some tools to perform certain tasks.
- A framework provides patterns and opinions that act as constraints around (mostly) business logic
