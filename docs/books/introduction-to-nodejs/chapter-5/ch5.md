# Chapter 5. Navigating the Ecosystem

## Introduction

The Node.js ecosystem is diverse and extensive. Node itself started out with a small core philosophy, encouraging innovation in the ecosystem instead of in core. Over time, the core has expanded slightly but it is still mostly necessary to rely heavily on third-party modules for higher-level functionality.

Freedom and flexibility has led to rampant open source innovation providing many ecosystem options, but in order to build products we have to invest in researching, evaluating and comparing those ecosystem options or else build absolutely everything ourselves form scratch at greater cost.
