# Mixu's Node book

> A book about using Node.js

## 1. Introduction

My ideal book is short, comprehensive and interesting.

In order to learn `Node`, you need to learn **_how to write code_** - not how to **_use a 3rd party library_** or a set of spells. I will recommend a few libraries, but the focus is on writing code yourself.

This book will cover more advanced topics - such as

- testing
- ES6
- single page applications
