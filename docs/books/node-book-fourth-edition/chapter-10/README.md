# üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Performance Optimization

In the case of a web server, this could be measuring how many requests our server can handle per second.

To identify the specific bottlenecks in an application using tools such as

- flame graphs
- memory profilers

Identifying a bottleneck is the first step to understanding where the optimization work should begin, and performance tools can help us determine the starting point.
