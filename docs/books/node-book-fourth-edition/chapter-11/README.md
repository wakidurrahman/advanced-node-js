# üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Node.js Microservices

This architecture encourages larger applications to be built as a set of smaller modular applications, where each application focuses on one key concern.

> [!TIP]
> Microservice architectures are a contrast to the monolithic architectures of the past.

Ensuring that an application only serves one purpose means that the application can be optimized to best serve that purpose.

Node.js microservices commonly expose **RESTful** APIs. **REST** stands for **Representational State Transfer**.

Microservice and container technology go hand in hand. Cloud and container technologies are growing in adopting, with Docker and Kubernetes being the leading choices for deploying microservice-based applications.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Generating a microservice with LoopBack

LoopBack 4 : LoopBack is a highly extensible, open-source Node.js and TypeScript framework based on Express. It enables you to quickly create APIs and microservices composed from backend systems such as databases and SOAP or REST services.

The diagram below demonstrates how LoopBack serves as a composition bridge between incoming requests and outgoing integrations.

![diagram](./lb4-high-level.png)

To use the LoopBack 4 command-line interface (CLI) to generate a Node.js microservice.

```sh
$ npm i -g @loopback/cli
```

To start generating

```sh
$ lb4 loopback-bookstore
```

Enter the following command to start creating a model:

```sh
$ lb4 model
```

we need to create our data source using LoopBack's data source CLI. Enter the following command in your Terminal window

```sh
$ lb4 datasource
```

we need to create a LoopBack repository. This is a LoopBack class that binds the data source and the model. Enter the following command to start the repository generator interface:

```sh
$ lb4 repository
```

we need to create a LoopBack controller. A LoopBack controller handles the API requests and responses. Enter the following command to start the controller generator interface:

```sh
$ lb4 controller
```

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Consuming a microservice

we'll extend the application to interact with the bookstore inventory microservice.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Handling errors

In microservice architectures, you will have many applications communicating together to form a larger system. When you have a system formed of many moving parts, it's important to handle `errors` within the system appropriately.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Building a Docker container

Cloud and container technologies go hand in hand, and one of the most prevalent container technologies is Docker.

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to `create`, `deploy`, and run applications using `containers`.

Docker and Kubernetes are large and complex technologies.

```sh
# Dockerfile

# select a new base image
FROM node:20

# Set to a non-root built-in user `node`
USER node

# Create app directory (with user `node`)
RUN mkdir -p /home/node/app

WORKDIR "/app"

RUN apt-get update \
    && apt-get dist-upgrade -y \
    && apt-get clean \
    && echo 'Finished installing dependencies'

# A wildcard is used to ensure both package.json AND package-lock.json are copied
COPY package*.json ./

RUN npm install --production

# Bundle app source code
COPY . /app

# Bind to all network interfaces so that it can be mapped to the host OS
ENV PORT 3000

EXPOSE 3000

USER node

CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]
```

Containers enable you to `package` your application into an `isolated` environment. Dockerfile is used to define the environment. The environment should include the libraries and dependencies that are required to run the application code.

Let's examine the contents of the `Dockerfile` file:

- üëâ `FROM node:20` : This instruction is used to initialize a new build stage. A `Dockerfile` file must start with a `FROM` instruction pointing to a valid Docker image that can be used as a `base` for our `image`. In this example, the `image` is based on the Docker official `Node.js image`.
- üëâ `RUN apt-get update...` : This line instructs Docker to update the containers' OS dependencies, using **Advanced Package Tool (APT)**, which is `Debian's` default package manager. It's important that `OS` dependencies are up to date to ensure that your dependencies contain the latest available fixes and patches.
- üëâ `COPY package*.json ./` : This copies the `package.json` and `package-lock.json` files, should they exist, into the container.
- üëâ `RUN npm install --production` : This executes the `npm install` command within the container based on the `package*.json` files copied earlier into the container. `npm install` must be run within the `container` as some `dependencies` may have native components that need to be built based on the container's `OS`.
- üëâ `COPY . /app` : This copies our application code into the `container`. Note that the `COPY` command will ignore all `patterns listed` in the `.dockerignore` file. This means that the COPY command will not copy `node_modules` and other information to the container.
- üëâ `ENV PORT 3000` : This sets the PORT environment variable in the container to 3000.
- üëâ `EXPOSE 3000` : The `EXPOSE` instruction is used as a `form of documentation` as to which port is intended to be `published` for the `containerized` application. **It does not publish the port**.
- üëâ `USER node` : This instructs Docker to run the image as the `node` user. The `node` user is created by the Docker official `Node.js image`. When omitted, the image will default to being run as the root user. You should run your containers as an unprivileged (non-root) user where possible as security mitigation.
- üëâ `CMD ["npm", "run", "start"]` : This executes the npm start command in the container, thereby starting the application.

```sh
# The below command builds the Docker image, based on the instructions in the Dockerfile file in the current directory.
$ docker build -t fastify-microservice .

# To run the image we call the below command. We pass this command the name of the image we'd like to run, and also the port we wish to expose.
$ docker run -p 3000:3000 fastify-microservice

# to view the Docker layers for an image using the docker `history` command.
$ docker history fastify-microservice

# to list your containers
$ docker ps

# to stop a container
$ docker stop <containerID>

# to remove a container
$ docker rm -f <containerID>

# to remove a Docker image
$ docker image rm <image> 

# to remove all images and containers on your system.
$ docker system prune --all

```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Once you've completed, you should stop and remove the Docker `containers` and `images`. Otherwise, the containers and images may linger on your system and consume system resources.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Publishing a Docker image

Docker Hub provides a global repository of images


Once you've created your Docker Hub account, you need to authenticate your Docker client.

```sh

$ docker login

# we then need to retag our image for it to be pushed to Docker Hub. Tag the image with the following command

$ docker tag fastify-microservice <namespace>/fastifymicroservice
or 
$ docker tag fastify-microservice <namespace>/fastifymicroservice:1.0.0

# we need to push the newly tagged image using the docker push command:
$ docker push <namespace>/fastify-microservice
or
$ docker push <namespace>/fastify-microservice:1.0.0

# It is also now possible to pull the image with the following command:
$ docker pull <namespace>/fastify-microservice
```

## #Ô∏è‚É£  Deploying to Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration and management system originally developed by Google.
Today, the Kubernetes project is maintained by the **Cloud Native Computing Foundation** (https://www.cncf.io/).

Kubernetes is a comprehensive and complex tool that provides the following features, among others:

- `Service` discovery and `load balancing`
- Storage orchestration
- Automated `rollouts` and `rollbacks`
- Automatic bin packing, specifying how much `CPU` and `memory` each container needs
- Self-healing
- `Secret` and `configuration` management

> [!TIP]
> An oversimplified description of Kubernetes is that it is a tool used to manage containers.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`Docker for Desktop`** is only available on `macOS` and `Windows` `OS`es. On Linux, an alternative is to use **`minikube`**, which is a tool that runs a Kubernetes cluster in a virtual machine on your local device.

We will be using the `kubectl` CLI to interact with our Kubernetes cluster.

```sh

$ kubectl version

$ kubectl get nodes

$ kubectl get services

$ kubectl get deployments

$ kubectl get pods

$ docker delete pod <podname>

$ kubectl apply -f deployment/fastify-app.yml

$ kubectl apply -f deployment/fastify-app-svc.yml

$ kubectl delete deployment fastify-app

$ kubectl delete service fastify-app-svc
```

The following is a selection of the commercial Kubernetes services available from leading cloud providers:

- Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service: https://aws.amazon.com/eks/
- Azure Kubernetes Service: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/kubernetes-service/
- Google Kubernetes Engine: https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine
- IBM Cloud Kubernetes Service: https://www.ibm.com/cloud/containerservice/details
