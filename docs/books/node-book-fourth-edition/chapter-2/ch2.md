# Handling Input/Output

Node.js brought JavaScript to the server and has enabled us to interact with the operating system with JavaScript.

Node.js interacts with the operating system at a fundamental level: input and output.

## Handling standard I/O

- `STDIN (standard in)`: refers to an input stream that a program can use to read input from a command shell or Terminal. Similarly,
- `STDOUT (standard out)`: refers to the stream that is used to write the output.
- `STDERR (standard error)`: is a separate stream to STDOUT that is typically reserved for outputting errors and diagnostic data.
