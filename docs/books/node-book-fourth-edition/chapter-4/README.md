# Web Protocols 

Node.js was built with web servers in mind.

application programming interfaces (APIs)
HyperText Transfer Protocol (HTTP)

It's important to have an understanding of how Node.js interacts with underlying `web protocols`, as these `web protocols` and fundamental concepts form the basis of most real-world web applications. Later,

Will cover the following:

- Using `http module` to make `HTTP` requests
- Building an `HTTP server` to accept GET requests
- Handling `HTTP` `POST` requests
- Using formidable to handle `file uploads`
- Using ws to create a `WebSocket` server
- Sending an automated `email` using your own `SMTP` server

HTTP: is a `stateless protocol` that was originally designed to facilitate communication between `web browsers` and `servers`.
