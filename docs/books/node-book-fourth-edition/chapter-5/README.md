# Developing NodeJS Modules

Node.js modules are `libraries` or a `set of functions` we want to include in our application. Most modules will provide an API to expose their functionality.
The `npm` registry is where most Node.js modules are stored, where there are over a `million` Node.js modules available.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> It is recommended to install Node.js with **Node Version Manager (nvm)**. It is a tool that enables you to easily switch Node.js versions on most Unix-like platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> npm` is the name of the Command-Line Interface tool (CLI) bundled with Node.js as the default package manager.

> [!IMPORTANT] > `Yarn` is a popular alternative package manager for JavaScript and was created as an alternative to the npm CLI in 2016.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Consuming Node.js modules

We are going to learn how to consume npm modules from the public `npm` registry using the `npm` **CLI**.

To install the `express module`, type the following command while in your project directory:

`$ npm install express`

After this command run.

- ‚û°Ô∏è The module has been added to a `dependencies` field inside `package.json` file.

```js
{
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.17.1"
    }
}
```

- ‚û°Ô∏è Both a `node_modules` directory and a `package-lock.json` file have now been created inside project directory.

> We used of both `npm` the `command-line interface` bundled with Node.js, and The `npm public registry` to download the third-party module.

The first command was `$ npm init`. This command initializes a new project in the current working directory.

Using `npm init` to Initialize a Project.

### üìù [The Basics: Getting started with npm](https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-getting-started-with-npm/)

### üìù The Essential npm Commands

When using `npm`, you're most likely using the command-line tool for most of your interactions.

The `npm init` command is a step-by-step tool to build out the scaffolding for your project. It will prompt for input on a few aspects in the following order:

1. `name:` Defaults to the containing directory name.
2. `initial version:` 1.0.0 by default.
3. `description:` An overview of what it is and why you're doing the project.
4. `entry point:` Meaning the `main` file is to be executed when run.
5. `test command:` To trigger testing with something like Standard.
6. `git repository:` Where the source code can be found.
7. `keywords:` Tags related to the project.
8. `license:` This defaults to ISC. Most open-source Node.js projects are MIT.

> [!TIP]
> The only properties that are mandatory are the package `name` and `version`.

It's worth noting that if you're content with the suggestion that the `npm init` command provides next to the prompt, you can hit or keys to accept it and move on to the following prompt.

Once you run through the `npm init` steps above, a `package.json` file will be generated and placed in the current directory.

```bash
$ npm init # This will trigger the initialization
```

```bash
$ npm init --yes # This will trigger automatically populated initialization
```

````bash
$ npm install <module>

$ npm install <module> # Where <module> is the name of the module  you want to install
$ npm i <module> # Where <module> is the name of the module you  want to install - using the i alias for installation

$ npm install <module> --save # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install - Kept for compatibility
$ npm install <module> --no-save # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install - To avoid adding it as a dependency

$ npm install <module> --save-dev # Where <module> is the name of  the  module you want to install

$ npm install <module> --global # Where <module> is the name of  the module you want to install globally```
$ npm install <module> -g # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install globally, using the -g alias
````

```bash
$ npm install express
```

It is also possible to configure default answers using the `npm config` command.

```bash
$ npm config set init.author.name "Your Name"
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> By default, when passed a name, the npm install command will look for a module with that name and download it from the public npm registry. But it is also possible to pass the `npm install` command other parameters, such as a `GitHub URL`, and the command will install the content of the `URL`.

When the `install` command completes, it will put the module contents into a
`node_modules` directory.

> [!TIP]
> If you look at the contents of the `node_modules` directory, We will notice that more than just the `express` module is present. This is because `express` has its own `dependencies`, and their `dependencies` may also have their own `dependencies`.

When installing a `module`, we're potentially installing a whole tree of modules.

Use the `$ npm list` command to list the contents of your `node_modules` directory.
`$ npm list`

The following output shows the structure of a node_modules directory
`$ ls node_modules`

> [!TIP]
> `package-lock.json` files were introduced in `npm` version `5`.

The difference between `package-lock.json` and `package.json` is that a `package-lock` file defines the specific versions of all of the modules in the `node_modules` tree.

It is possible that two `developers` with the same `package.json` files may experience different results when running `$ npm install`. This is mainly due to the fact that a `package.json` file can specify **acceptable module ranges**.

For example, we installed the latest version of express, and this resulted in the following range:

```js
{
  ...,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

> [!TIP] 
> `^ ` indicates that it will allow all versions aboveüëÜ `v4.18.2` to be installed, but not v5.x.x.

If `v4.18.3` was to be released in the time between when developer `A` and developer `B` run the
`npm install` command, then it is likely that developer `A` will get version üëâ `v4.18.2` and
developer `B` will get version üëâ `v4.18.3`.

If the `package-lock.json` file is **shared between the developers**, they will be guaranteed the installation of the same `version` of `express` and the same versions of all of the `dependencies` of `express`.

Imported the `express` module to test whether it was accessible inside `require-express.js` file.

```js
const express = require("express");
```

> [!NOTE]
> Note that this is the same way in which we `import` Node.js `core` modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`. The module loading algorithm will first check to see whether you're requiring a core `Node.js` module; it will then look in the `node_modules` folder to find the `module` with that name.

It is also possible to require specific files by passing a relative path, such as the following:

```JS
const file = require("./file.js");
```

### üìù Development dependencies

`Development dependencies` (`devDependencies`) are typically used for tooling that supports you in developing your application.

`Development dependencies` should not be required to run your application.

Having a distinction between `dependencies`(`"dependencies": {...}`) that are required for your application to run and `dependencies` that are required to `develop` your application is particularly useful when it comes to `deploying` your application.

Your `production` application `deployment` can omit the `development dependencies` (`"devDependencies": { "prettier": "2.0.5" }`), which makes the resulting `production` application much **smaller**. Smaller deployments reduce the cost of deployment.

A very common use of `development dependencies` is for `linters` and `formatters`.
`prettier` is a tool that reformats your code consistently. For a much more customizable linter, you should consider using `eslint`.

To install prettier, we can use the following:

```bash
$ npm install --save-dev --save-exact prettier
```

- To install a development dependency, you need to supply the install command with the `--save-dev` parameter.
- `--save-exact` pins the exact version in your package.json file. This is recommended when using `prettier` as `patch` `releases` may introduce new style `rules`, which when automatically picked up, could be `troublesome`.

### üìù Global modules

Typically, the type of modules you'll install globally are binaries or a program that you want to be accessible in your shell. To globally install a module, you pass the --global command to the install command as follows:

````bash

$ npm install <module> --global # Where <module> is the name of  the module you want to install globally```
$ npm install <module> -g # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install globally, using the -g alias

$ sudo npm install -g typescript
````

This will not install typescript into your `node_module` folder. Instead, it will be installed into the `bin` directory of your `Node.js` `installation`.

In `npm` version v5.2, `npm` added the `npx` command to their CLI. This command allows you to execute a global module without having it **permanently** stored.

```bash
$ npx lolcatjs
```

In general, `npx` should be sufficient for most modules that you wish to execute. However, if you want the global module to be `permanently` available `offline`, then you may wish to still globally install the module rather than using the `npx` command.

### üìù Responsibly consuming modules

There are many considerations you should take when choosing a Node.js module to include in your application. The following few considerations should be taken in particular:

1. `Security` : Can you depend on the module to fix security vulnerabilities?
2. `Licenses` : If you link with open source libraries and then distribute the software, your software needs to be compliant with the licenses of the linked libraries. Licenses can vary from restrictive/protective to permissive.
3. `Maintenance`: You'll also need to consider how well maintained the module is. The majority of modules publish their source code to GitHub and have their `bug reports` viewable as GitHub `issues`. From viewing their `issues` and **how/when** the maintainers are responding to `bug reports`, you should be able to get some insight into how maintained the module is.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Setting up your own module

For our own module,

- üëâ Will set up a typical file
- üëâ Directory structure for our module
- üëâ Learn how to initialize our project with the npm CLI.
- üëâ Create a GitHub repository to store our module code.

The module we're going to make : ‚û°Ô∏è **üëÅÔ∏è will expose an API that reverses the sentence we pass to it**.

To make a new directory for our module we will require to have

1. GitHub account `https://github.com/wakidurrahman`
2. npm account `https://www.npmjs.com/~wakidurrahman`

Process of creating a Module

- Using the `npm` CLI to initialize our `reverse-sentence-nodejs-module` module `$ npm init --yes`
- Create a GitHub repository to store our module code. üìí **_Note_** : that the repository name does not have to match the module name.
- Recommended to add the default `.gitignore` for Node.js
- GitHub remote repository for the repository field. This will update our package.json file's repository field to the following
  ![repository](./repository.png)

It was then possible to reinitialize our module by re-running the `$ npm init` command.

### üìù semver (semantic versioning)

we specified the module version as `v0.1.0` to adhere to semantic versioning.

Semantic version, often abbreviated to `semver`, is a well-known standard for versioning.
The NodeJS release schedule is based on the [`Semantic Versioning`](https://semver.org/) standard.
Node.js itself tries to adhere to semantic versioning as much as possible.

Given a version number `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH`, increment the:

1. `MAJOR` version when you **make incompatible API changes**
2. `MINOR` version when you **add functionality in a backward compatible manner**
3. `PATCH` version when you **make backward compatible bug fixes**

Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the `MAJOR`.`MINOR`.`PATCH` format.

Semantic version numbers are in the form of X.Y.Z:

1. X represents the `major` version.
2. Y represents the `minor` version.
3. Z represents the `patch` version.

Semantic Versioning states that you increment

> The `major` version, the first value, when you make breaking API changes.

> The second number, the minor version, is incremented when new features have been added in a backward-compatible (or non-breaking) manner.

> The patch version, or the third number, is for bug fixes and non-breaking and non-additive updates.

```js
"version": "0.1.0",
```

The `major` `version` `0` is reserved for initial development and it is acceptable to make breaking changes up until `v1` is released.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Implementing your module

The module will expose a single API that will reverse the sentence we pass to it. We'll also install a popular code formatter to keep our module code consistent.

```js
"use strict";

/**
 * To reverse the sentence.
 * @param {*} sentence : expect string
 * @returns
 */

function reverseSentence(sentence) {
  // to split the sentence into an array of single-word strings
  const wordsArray = sentence.split(" ");

  // to reverse the array
  const reversedArray = wordsArray.reverse();

  // to join the elements of the array back together to reform the sentence as a string.
  const reversedSentence = reversedArray.join(" ");

  return reversedSentence;
}

module.exports = reverseSentence;
```

`module.exports` is an object that is accessible in all `Node.js JavaScript` by default. Whatever is assigned to the `module.exports` object is `exposed`.

```bash
$ node --print "require('./')('Hello Beth\!')"
```

We tested our module by passing the `--print` argument to the Node.js process. The `‚Äìprint` flag evaluates the statement or expression supplied and outputs the result.

First authenticated our local npm client using the `$ npm login` command. provides the ability to set up access controls so that certain users can publish to specific modules or scopes.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Preparing and publishing your module to npm

Publishing your module to the npm registry will make it available for other developers to find and include in their application. This is how the `npm` ecosystem operates: developers will author and `publish` modules to `npm` for other developers to consume and reuse in their `Node.js` application.

First authenticated our local `npm` client using the `$ npm login` command. `npm` provides the ability to set up access controls so that certain users can publish to specific modules or scopes.

`$ npm login` identifies who you are and where you're entitled to publish. It is also possible to log out using `$ npm logout`.

Can authorize your npm client `$ npm login` but it is depend on below `.npmrc` set npm configuration variables, such as credentials, registry location `.npmrc` file to use for reference:

```sh
registry=https://registry.npmjs.com/
email=example@mail.com
always-auth=true
//registry.npmjs.com/:_auth=npm_432112dfdkk

```

It is ideal to keep your public GitHub repository up to date. Typically, module authors will create a `"tag"` on GitHub that matches the version that is pushed to `npm`.
This can act as an audit trail for users wishing to see the source code of the module at a particular version, without having to download it via npm.

> [!NOTE]
> However, please note That nothing is enforcing a rule that the code you publish to npm has to match the code you publish to GitHub:

```sh

$ git add .
$ git commit -m "v0.1.0"
$ git push origin master
$ git tag v0.1.0
$ git push origin v0.1.0

```

### ‚ô®Ô∏è üì¢ üí™ To publish our module to the npm registry using the following command:

The command that did the actual publishing to the registry was the following:

```sh
$ npm publish --access=public

```

1. Github Repository [reverse-sentence-nodejs-module](https://github.com/wakidurrahman/reverse-sentence-nodejs-module)
2. NPM package [@wakidurrahman/reverse-sentence-nodejs-module](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wakidurrahman/reverse-sentence-nodejs-module?activeTab=readme)

The npm publish command attempts to publish the package at the location identified by the name field in the `package.json`.

We published it to a `scoped` package specifically, we used our own username's(`@wakidurrahman`) scope. `Scoped` packages help to avoid naming conflicts. It is possible to publish your package to the `global scope` by not passing it a named scope but you're likely to run into name conflicts if your package has a common name.

We also passed the `--access=public` flag. When publishing to a `scoped` package, we explicitly need to indicate that we want the module to be public. `npm` allows you to publish your modules as either `public` or `private` for `scoped` packages. To publish a module `privately`, you need to have a `paid npm account`.

> [!NOTE] > **_Note_** : that the `--access=public` flag is not required when publishing to the `global scope` because all modules in the global `namespace` are public.

```sh
{
  "name": "@wakidurrahman/reverse-sentence-nodejs-module",
}
```

The `npm` `publish` command packaged up our module code and uploaded it to the `npm` registry. Because the `package.json` generated from the `$ npm init` command is generated with consistent properties, `npm` can extract and render that information on the modules page.

> [!TIP]
> üì¢ Publish was successful by [navigating to](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@wakidurrahman/reverse-sentence-nodejs-module).Expect to see the following information about your module:

![Fig](./reverse-sentence-nodejs-module.png)

### üìù Prepublish scripts

`npm` supports a `prepublishOnly` script. This script will only run before the module is packaged and published. This is useful for catching mistakes before publishing.

adding a prepublishOnly script to our module.

```sh
"scripts": {
  "prepublish": "npm run lint"
}
```

Typically, module authors will include rerunning their test suite in their prepublish scripts:

```sh
"prepublish": "npm run lint && npm test",
```

### üìù `.npmignore`

`.npmignore` omits the files listed in it from the package. `.npmignore` files are not mandatory, and if you do not have one but do have a `.gitignore` file, then npm will omit the files and directories matched by the `.gitignore` file. The `.npmignore` file will override `.gitignore` if one exists.

### üìù Private registries

A private registry is a registry that has been set up with some form of access control.

Typically, these are set up by **`businesses`** and **`organizations`** `#RRGGBB` that wish to keep some of their `code off` the public registry, potentially due to policy restrictions determined by their business.

This enables the business to share their modules among members of the same **organization**
while adhering to the business policy. Equally, a private registry can be used as a caching-mechanism.
