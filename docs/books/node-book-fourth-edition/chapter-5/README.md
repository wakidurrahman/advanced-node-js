# Developing NodeJS Modules

Node.js modules are `libraries` or a `set of functions` we want to include in our application. Most modules will provide an API to expose their functionality.
The `npm` registry is where most Node.js modules are stored, where there are over a `million` Node.js modules available.

üìí **_Important note_** : It is recommended to install Node.js with **Node Version Manager (nvm)**. It is a tool that enables you to easily switch Node.js versions on most Unix-like platforms.

üìí **_Important note_** : `npm` is the name of the Command-Line Interface tool (CLI) bundled with Node.js as the default package manager.

üìí **_Important note_** : `Yarn` is a popular alternative package manager for JavaScript and was created as an alternative to the npm CLI in 2016.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Consuming Node.js modules

We are going to learn how to consume npm modules from the public `npm` registry using the `npm` **CLI**.

To install the `express module`, type the following command while in your project directory:

`$ npm install express`

After this command run.

- ‚û°Ô∏è The module has been added to a `dependencies` field inside `package.json` file.

```js
{
    "dependencies": {
        "express": "^4.17.1"
    }
}
```

- ‚û°Ô∏è Both a `node_modules` directory and a `package-lock.json` file have now been created inside project directory.

> We used of both `npm` the `command-line interface` bundled with Node.js, and The `npm public registry` to download the third-party module.

The first command was `$ npm init`. This command initializes a new project in the current working directory.

Using `npm init` to Initialize a Project.

### üìù [The Basics: Getting started with npm](https://nodesource.com/blog/the-basics-getting-started-with-npm/)

Today, `npm` is a cornerstone of modern web development, whether used exclusively with Node.js as a package manager or as a build tool for the front end.

1. The Essential npm Commands

   - Using `npm init` to initialize a project
   - Using `npm init --yes` to instantly initialize a project
   - Install modules with `npm install`
   - Install modules and save them to your `package.json` as a dependency
   - Install modules and save them to your `package.json` as a developer dependency
   - Install modules globally on your system

2. The Basics of package.json

   2.1. Identifying Metadata Inside package.json

   - The `name` property
   - The `version` property
   - The `license` property
   - The `description` property
   - The `keywords` property

     2.2. functional metadata inside package.json

   - The `main` property
   - The `repository` property
   - The `script` property
   - The `dependencies` property
   - The `devDependencies` property

3. Understanding the different types of dependencies and other host Specs inside package.json

- PeerDependencies
- PeerDependenciesMeta
- OptionalDependencies
- BundledDependencies
- engines
- os
- cpu

**_The Essential npm Commands_**

When using npm, you're most likely using the command-line tool for most of your interactions.

The `npm init` command is a step-by-step tool to build out the scaffolding for your project. It will prompt for input on a few aspects in the following order:

1. `name:` Defaults to the containing directory name.
2. `initial version:` 1.0.0 by default.
3. `description:` An overview of what it is and why you're doing the project.
4. `entry point:` Meaning the `main` file is to be executed when run.
5. `test command:` To trigger testing with something like Standard.
6. `git repository:` Where the source code can be found.
7. `keywords:` Tags related to the project.
8. `license:` This defaults to ISC. Most open-source Node.js projects are MIT.

> **The only properties that are mandatory are the package `name` and `version`.**

It's worth noting that if you're content with the suggestion that the `npm init` command provides next to the prompt, you can hit or keys to accept it and move on to the following prompt.

Once you run through the `npm init` steps above, a `package.json` file will be generated and placed in the current directory.

```bash
$ npm init # This will trigger the initialization
```

```bash
$ npm init --yes # This will trigger automatically populated initialization
```

````bash
$ npm install <module>

$ npm install <module> # Where <module> is the name of the module  you want to install
$ npm i <module> # Where <module> is the name of the module you  want to install - using the i alias for installation

$ npm install <module> --save # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install - Kept for compatibility
$ npm install <module> --no-save # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install - To avoid adding it as a dependency

$ npm install <module> --save-dev # Where <module> is the name of  the  module you want to install

$ npm install <module> --global # Where <module> is the name of  the module you want to install globally```
$ npm install <module> -g # Where <module> is the name of the  module you want to install globally, using the -g alias
````

```bash
$ npm install express
```

It is also possible to configure default answers using the `npm config` command.

```bash
$ npm config set init.author.name "Your Name"
```

üìí **_Important note_** : By default, when passed a name, the npm install command will look for a module with that name and download it from the public npm registry. But it is also possible to pass the `npm install` command other parameters, such as a `GitHub URL`, and the command will install the content of the `URL`.

When the `install` command completes, it will put the module contents into a
`node_modules` directory.

> If you look at the contents of the `node_modules` directory, We will notice that more than just the `express` module is present. This is because `express` has its own `dependencies`, and their `dependencies` may also have their own `dependencies`.

When installing a `module`, we're potentially installing a whole tree of modules.

Use the `$ npm list` command to list the contents of your `node_modules` directory.
`$ npm list`

The following output shows the structure of a node_modules directory
`$ ls node_modules`

> `package-lock.json` files were introduced in `npm` version `5`.

The difference between `package-lock.json` and `package.json` is that a `package-lock` file defines the specific versions of all of the modules in the `node_modules` tree.

It is possible that two `developers` with the same `package.json` files may experience different results when running `$ npm install`. This is mainly due to the fact that a `package.json` file can specify **acceptable module ranges**.

For example, we installed the latest version of express, and this resulted in the following range:

```js
{
  ...,
  "dependencies": {
    "express": "^4.18.2"
  }
}
```

`^ ` indicates that it will allow all versions aboveüëÜ `v4.18.2` to be installed, but not v5.x.x.

If `v4.18.3` was to be released in the time between when developer `A` and developer `B` run the
`npm install` command, then it is likely that developer `A` will get version üëâ `v4.18.2` and
developer `B` will get version üëâ `v4.18.3`.

If the `package-lock.json` file is **shared between the developers**, they will be guaranteed the installation of the same `version` of `express` and the same versions of all of the `dependencies` of `express`.

Imported the `express` module to test whether it was accessible inside `require-express.js` file.

```js
const express = require("express");
```

üìí **_Note_** : that this is the same way in which we `import` Node.js `core` modules like `fs`, `http`, `path`. The module loading algorithm will first check to see whether you're requiring a core `Node.js` module; it will then look in the `node_modules` folder to find the `module` with that name.

It is also possible to require specific files by passing a relative path, such as the following:

```JS
const file = require("./file.js");
```
