# Preface

Today, NodeJS is a common technology of choice for building applications of all sizes. Many large enterprises use NodeJS in `production`, including like of `Netflix`, `PayPal`, `IBM`, and even `NASA`. NodeJS was moved under the OpenJS Foundation (formerly the NodeJS Foundation).

NodeJS created in 2009, it wrapped Google Chrome's JavaScript Engine,V8, to enable JavaScript to be run outside the browser. NodeJS brought JavaScript to the server and vas built following a `single-threaded` `event loop` architecture, which enables it to effectively handle input/output and concurrent operation.

Today, Node.js is a popular technology choice for building many types of applications, including

- HTTP web servers,
- Microservices,
- Command-line applications, and more.

**_Key to Node.js's success is that it enables full-stack development in a common language, JavaScript._**

The massive ecosystem of Node.js modules has supported Node.js's success. There are over 1 million modules available on the npm registry, with many abstracting lower-level implementation details to higher-level and more easily consumable APIs.

## Who this book is for.

- Who want to gain a broad understanding of fundamental Node.js concepts.
- This book will provide a base understanding that will allow you to start building fast, efficient, and scalable Node.js applications.
