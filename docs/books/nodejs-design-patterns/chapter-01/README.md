# üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è The Node.js Platform

The most peculiar one is probably its asynchronous nature, which makes heavy use of asynchronous constructs such as `callbacks` and `promises`.

We will explore where Node.js gets its asynchronous behavior from. This is not just good-to-know theoretical information: knowing how Node.js works at its core will give you a strong foundation for understanding.

Another important aspect that characterizes Node.js is its philosophy. ‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶∞‡ßÅ‡¶§‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶™‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶£ ‡¶¶‡¶ø‡¶ï ‡¶Ø‡¶æ Node.js ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶≤ ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶¶‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶∂‡¶®‡•§

## #Ô∏è‚É£ The Node.js philosophy

Every programming platform has its own **philosophy**, a set of _principles_ and _guidelines_ that are generally accepted by the community, or an ideology for doing things that influence both the evolution of the platform and how applications are developed and designed.

In Node.js, some of these principles come directly from its creator **‚ÄîRyan Dahl‚Äî** while others come from the people who contribute to the core or from charismatic figures in **the community**, and, finally, some are inherited from the **larger JavaScript movement**.

### üìù Small core

The Node.js core ‚Äîunderstood as the Node.js runtime and built-in modules‚Äî(Node.js ‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶®‡¶ü‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶Æ ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶≤‡ßç‡¶ü-‡¶á‡¶® ‡¶Æ‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶â‡¶≤ ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶¨‡ßã‡¶ù‡¶æ ‡¶Ø‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º) has its foundations built on a few principles. ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶≠‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶§‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶â‡¶™‡¶∞ ‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Æ‡¶ø‡¶§‡•§

### üìù Small modules

Node.js uses the concept of a module as the fundamental means for structuring the code of a program. It is the building block for creating applications and reusable libraries.

This principle has its roots in the Unix philosophy, and particularly in two of its precepts, which are as follows:

- "Small is beautiful."
- "Make each program do one thing well."

Node.js has brought these concepts to a whole new level. Along with the help of its module managers **‚Äîwith `npm` and `yarn` being the most popular‚Äî** Node.js helps to solve the **_`dependency hell`_** problem by making sure that two (or more) packages depending on different versions of the same package will use their own installations of such a package, thus avoiding conflicts.

### üìù Small surface area

In addition to being small in size and scope, a desirable characteristic of Node.js modules is exposing a minimal set of functionalities to the outside world. ‡¶Ü‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶Ø‡ßã‡¶ó‡ßá ‡¶õ‡ßã‡¶ü ‡¶π‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∂‡¶æ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∂‡¶ø, Node.js ‡¶Æ‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶â‡¶≤‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶™‡¶õ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶‡¶∏‡¶á ‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßÇ‡¶®‡¶§‡¶Æ ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶ü ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶õ‡ßá‡•§

In Node.js, a very common pattern for defining modules is to expose only one `functionality`, such as a `function` or a `class`,

Another characteristic of many Node.js modules is the fact that they are created to be used, rather than extended. Locking down the internals of a module by forbidding any possibility of an extension might sound inflexible, but it actually has the advantage of reducing use cases, simplifying implementation, facilitating maintenance, and increasing usability. In practice, this means preferring to expose functions instead of classes, and being careful not to expose any internals to the outside world. ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßá‡¶ï Node.js ‡¶Æ‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶â‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Ü‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶¨‡ßà‡¶∂‡¶ø‡¶∑‡ßç‡¶ü‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶π‡¶≤ ‡¶è‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶ú‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶§‡ßà‡¶∞‡¶ø ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá‡•§ ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶Æ‡¶°‡¶ø‡¶â‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶Ö‡¶≠‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶£ ‡¶Ö‡¶Ç‡¶∂‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶≤‡¶ï ‡¶°‡¶æ‡¶â‡¶® ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶è‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∏‡¶ü‡ßá‡¶®‡¶∂‡¶®‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶®‡¶ì ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶≠‡¶æ‡¶¨‡¶®‡¶æ‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡¶Æ‡¶®‡ßÄ‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶Æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶π‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá, ‡¶§‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶Ü‡¶∏‡¶≤‡ßá ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßá‡¶§‡ßç‡¶∞‡ßá ‡¶π‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∏ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ, ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßç‡¶§‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶®‡¶ï‡ßá ‡¶∏‡¶∞‡¶≤ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ, ‡¶∞‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶£‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡¶£ ‡¶∏‡¶π‡¶ú‡¶§‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶¨‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶¨‡¶π‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶Ø‡ßã‡¶ó‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶§‡¶æ ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶°‡¶º‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßã‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡ßÅ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶æ ‡¶∞‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá‡¶õ‡ßá‡ß∑ ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßÅ‡¶∂‡ßÄ‡¶≤‡¶®‡ßá, ‡¶è‡¶∞ ‡¶Ö‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶• ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶™‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶¨‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶´‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶∂‡¶®‡¶ó‡ßÅ‡¶≤‡¶ø ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶§‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶õ‡¶®‡ßç‡¶¶ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶á‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∂‡ßç‡¶¨‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶õ‡ßá ‡¶ï‡ßã‡¶®‡¶ì ‡¶Ö‡¶≠‡ßç‡¶Ø‡¶®‡ßç‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶£ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶∂ ‡¶®‡¶æ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶∑‡¶Ø‡¶º‡ßá ‡¶∏‡¶§‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶ï ‡¶π‡¶ì‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ‡•§

### üìù Simplicity and pragmatism

Keep It Simple, Stupid (KISS) principle

Designing simple, as opposed to perfect, fully featured software is a good practice for several reasons: it takes less effort to implement, it allows shipping faster with fewer resources, it's easier to adapt, and, finally, it's easier to maintain and understand.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ How Node.js works

Node.js works internally and be introduced to the **_reactor pattern_**, which is the heart of the asynchronous nature of Node.js.

The main concepts behind the pattern, such as the single-threaded architecture and the non-blocking I/O

### üìù I/O is slow

I/O (short for input/output) is definitely the slowest among the fundamental
operations of operations of a computer.
I/O is usually not expensive in terms of CPU, but it adds a delay between the moment the request is sent to the device and the moment the operation completes.

### üìù Blocking I/O

In traditional blocking `I/O` programming, the function call corresponding to an `I/O` request will block the execution of the `thread` until the **_operation completes_**. This is because each I/O operation on a socket will block the processing of any other connection.

### üìù Non-blocking I/O

In addition to blocking I/O, most modern operating systems support another mechanism to access resources, called non-blocking I/O. In this operating mode, the system call always returns immediately without waiting for the data to be read or written.

The most basic pattern for dealing with this type of non-blocking I/O is to actively poll the resource within a loop until some actual data is returned. This is called **_busy-waiting_**.

Polling algorithms usually result in a huge amount of wasted CPU time.

### üìù Event demultiplexing

We are talking about the **synchronous event demultiplexer** (also known as the **event notification interface**).

**_Multiplexing:_** the term, in telecommunications, multiplexing refers to the method by which multiple signals are combined into one so that they can be easily transmitted over a medium with limited capacity.

**_Demultiplexing:_** refers to the opposite operation, whereby the signal is split again into its original components. ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶™‡¶∞‡ßÄ‡¶§ ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶® ‡¶¨‡ßã‡¶ù‡¶æ‡¶Ø‡¶º, ‡¶Ø‡ßá‡¶ñ‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ï‡ßá‡¶§ ‡¶Ü‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶§‡¶æ‡¶∞ ‡¶Æ‡ßÇ‡¶≤ ‡¶â‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶¶‡¶æ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶¨‡¶ø‡¶≠‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡•§

The **synchronous event demultiplexer** watches multiple resources and returns a new event (or set of events) when a `read` or `write` operation executed over one of those resources completes. synchronous event demultiplexer ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶æ‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶ï resources ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶ñ‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø ‡¶®‡¶§‡ßÅ‡¶® event (‡¶¨‡¶æ events ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶ü) ‡¶´‡ßá‡¶∞‡¶§ ‡¶¶‡ßá‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶Ø‡¶ñ‡¶® ‡¶∏‡ßá‡¶á resources ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø‡¶∞ ‡¶â‡¶™‡¶∞ ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø read ‡¶¨‡¶æ write ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶ø‡¶Ø‡¶º‡¶æ ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™‡¶®‡ßç‡¶® ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡•§

## #Ô∏è‚É£ The reactor pattern

The main idea behind the **_Reactor Pattern_** is to have a `handler` associated **with each I/O operation**. A `handler` in Node.js is represented by a `callback` (or `cb` for short) function. Reactor Pattern ‡¶™‡¶ø‡¶õ‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶Æ‡ßÇ‡¶≤ ‡¶ß‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶£‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶≤ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶ü‡¶ø I/O ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶®‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø handler ‡¶Ø‡ßÅ‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶§ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ‡•§ Node.js-‡¶è ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø handler ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø callback (‡¶¨‡¶æ ‡¶∏‡¶Ç‡¶ï‡ßç‡¶∑‡ßá‡¶™‡ßá cb) function ‡¶¶‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶™‡ßç‡¶∞‡¶§‡¶ø‡¶®‡¶ø‡¶ß‡¶ø‡¶§‡ßç‡¶¨ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡•§ The handler will be invoked as soon as an event is produced and processed by the event loop.

> [!NOTE]
> A Node.js application will exit when there are no more pending operations in the event demultiplexer, and no more events to be processed inside the event queue.

> [!IMPORTANT] > **`The reactor pattern:`** Handles I/O by blocking until new events are available from a set of observed resources, and then reacts by dispatching each event to an associated handler.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Libuv, the I/O engine of Node.js

Each opearating system has its own interface for the Event Demultiplexer:

- `epoll`: on Linux,
- `kqueue`: on macOS,
- `I/O completion port (IOCP) API`: on Windows

On top of that, each `I/O` operation can behave quite differently depending on the **type of resource**, even within the **same operating system**.

All these inconsistencies across and within the different operating systems required a higher-level abstraction to be built for the event demultiplexer.

The Node.js core team created a native library called `libuv`, with the objective to make Node.js compatible with all the major operating systems and normalize the non-blocking behavior of the different types of resource.

> [!IMPORTANT] > `libuv` represents the low-level I/O **engine** of Node.js and is probably the most important component that Node.js is built on.

Other than abstracting the underlying system calls, `libuv` also implements the **_Reactor Pattern_**, thus providing an API for creating `event loops`, managing the `event queue`, running `asynchronous I/O operations`, and queuing other types of task.

### üìù The recipe for Node.js

The reactor pattern and libuv are the basic building blocks of Node.js, but we need three more components to build the full platform:

- Bindings: A set of bindings responsible for wrapping and exposing libuv and other low-level functionalities to JavaScript. 
- V8: The Javascript engine.
- Core Javascript API: A core JavaScript library that implements the high-level node.js API.
