This approach makes the code very easy to read, understand, and debug.

üîÅ üÖ∞Ô∏è üá¶ üîÑ **_Asynchronous Programming:_** some operations, such as reading from a `file` or performing a `network` request, are launched and then executed "in the background."

**_The callback:_**, which is nothing more than a function invoked by `the runtime` with the result of an asynchronous operation.

## #Ô∏è‚É£ The Callback pattern

**Callbacks**: are functions that are invoked to propagate the result of an operation.

JavaScript is the ideal language for `callbacks` because functions are **_first-class_** objects and can be easily.

- function assigned to variables,
- function passed as arguments,
- function returned from another function invocation,
- function stored in data structures,

Another ideal construct for implementing callbacks is `closures`.

### üìù The continuation-passing style

In JavaScript, a callback is a function that is passed as an argument to another function and is invoked with the result when the operation completes.(JavaScript ‡¶Æ‡¶ß‡ßç‡¶Ø‡ßá, ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø callback ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø function ‡¶Ø‡¶æ ‡¶Ö‡¶®‡ßç‡¶Ø ‡¶´‡¶æ‡¶Ç‡¶∂‡¶®‡ßá ‡¶è‡¶ï‡¶ü‡¶ø argument ‡¶π‡¶ø‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶¨‡ßá ‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∏ ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶è‡¶¨‡¶Ç ‡¶Ø‡¶ñ‡¶® ‡¶Ö‡¶™‡¶æ‡¶∞‡ßá‡¶∂‡¶® ‡¶∏‡¶Æ‡ßç‡¶™‡ßÇ‡¶∞‡ßç‡¶£ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º ‡¶§‡¶ñ‡¶® ‡¶´‡¶≤‡¶æ‡¶´‡¶≤‡ßá‡¶∞ ‡¶∏‡¶æ‡¶•‡ßá ‡¶Ü‡¶π‡ßç‡¶¨‡¶æ‡¶® ‡¶ï‡¶∞‡¶æ ‡¶π‡¶Ø‡¶º‡•§)

> [!NOTE]
> In functional programming, this way of propagating the result is called continuation-passing style (CPS).

### üìù Synchronous continuation-passing style (CPS).

```js
function addCps(a, b, callback) {
  callback(a + b);
}

addCps(1, 2, (result) => console.log(`Result: ${result}`));
```

### üìù Asynchronous continuation-passing style (CPS).

we used setTimeout() to simulate an asynchronous invocation of the callback.
`setTimeout()` adds a task to the event queue that is executed after the given number of milliseconds.

```js
function addAsyncCps(a, b, callback) {
  setTimeout(() => callback(a + b), 100);
}

additionAsync(1, 2, (result) => console.log(`Result: ${result}`));
```

Since `setTimeout()` triggers an asynchronous operation, it doesn't wait for the callback to be executed; instead, it returns immediately, giving the control back to addAsyncCps(), and then back again to its caller.

### üìù Non-CPS callbacks

```js
const result = [1, 5, 7].map((element) => element - 1);
console.log(result); // [0, 4, 6]
```

The callback is used just to iterate over the elements of the array, and not to pass the result of the operation. In fact, the result is returned synchronously using a **_direct style_**.

### üìù Using synchronous APIs

using a synchronous API instead of an asynchronous one has some caveats:

- A synchronous API for a specific functionality might not always be available.
- A synchronous API will block the event loop and put any concurrent requests on hold.
- A synchronous API will break the Node.js concurrency model, slowing down the whole application.

The risk of blocking the event loop is partially mitigated because the synchronous I/O API is invoked only once per filename, while

Using synchronous I/O in Node.js is strongly discouraged in many circumstances

> [!TIP]
> It makes perfect sense to use a synchronous blocking API to load a configuration file while bootstrapping an application.

### üìù Guaranteeing asynchronicity with deferred execution

In Node.js, with process.nextTick(), which defers the execution of a function after the currently running operation completes. Its functionality is very simple: it takes a `callback` as an argument and pushes it to the top üîù of the `event queue`, in front of any pending `I/O` event, and returns immediately. The `callback` will then be invoked as soon as the currently running operation yields control back to the `event loop`.

```js
process.nextTick(() => callback(cache.get(filename)));
```

## #Ô∏è‚É£ Node.js callback conventions

In Node.js, CPS APIs and callbacks follow a set of specific conventions. These conventions apply to the Node.js core API, but they are also followed by the vast majority of the userland modules and applications.

### üìù The callback comes last

In all core Node.js functions, the standard convention is that when a function accepts a `callback` as input, this has to be passed as the **last argument**.

Let's take the following Node.js core API as an example:

```js
readFile(filename, [options], callback);
```

The reason for this convention is that the function call is more readable in case the `callback` is defined in place.
