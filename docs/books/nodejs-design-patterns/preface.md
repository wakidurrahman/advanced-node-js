# 💁‍♂️ Preface

Node.js is considered by many a game-changer—possibly the biggest innovation of the decade in web development.

1. 👉 Node.js applications are written in JavaScript, the most adopted language on the `web` and the only programming language supported **natively** by every **web browser**.
2. 👉 Node.js' single-threaded programming model and its asynchronous architecture.
3. 👉 Node.js lies in its ecosystem: the npm package manager, its constantly growing database of modules, its enthusiastic and helpful community, and most importantly, its very own culture based on simplicity, pragmatism, and extreme modularity.

Developer new to this paradigm will often feel unsure about how to tackle even the most common design and coding problems effectively. Common questions include:

- How do I organize my code? 
- What's the best way to design this? 
- How can I make my application more modular? 
- How do I handle a set of asynchronous calls effectively? 
- How can I make sure that my application will not collapse while it grows?
- what's the right way to implement this?


Fortunately, Node.js has become a mature enough platform and most of these questions can now be easily answered with a **design pattern**, a proven **coding technique**, or a **recommended practice**.

## Who this book is for.

This book is for developers who have already had initial contact with Node.js and now want to get the most out of it in terms of **productivity**, **design quality**, and **scalability**.

- Developers with **intermediate experience** in Node.js will also find the techniques presented in this book beneficial.
- Some background in software design theory is also an **advantage** to understand some of the concepts presented.

This book assumes that you have a working knowledge of **web application development**, **web services**, **databases**, and **data structures**.
