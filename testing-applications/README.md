# Testing:

Testing enables you to identify bugs in your code more quickly and efficiently.
Test cases should be written to verify that each piece of code is giving the expected output or result.
Tests can act as a form of documentation for the logic of your program.

Unit testing is a specific type of testing where individual components or units of code are tested.

Small `unit` tests provide a granular specification for your program to test against. Ensuring your `code base` is covered by `unit` tests aids the `development`, `debugging`, and `refactoring` process by providing a baseline measure of quality. Having a comprehensive test suite can lead to identifying `bugs` sooner, which can save `time` and `money` since the earlier a `bug` is found, the cheaper it is to fix.

Learn about testing frameworks like `Mocha` or `Jest`.
Understand how to write `unit tests` and `integration tests` for your `Node.js` applications.
